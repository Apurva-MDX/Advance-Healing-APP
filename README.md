# Advance Healing APP

Mental health has been a huge complication in the world for a long time, especially since
the COVID-19 pandemic occurred. The purpose of the project is to improve stress
management but also a complicated process which involves improving a person’s mental
health. There are many applications out there, but each mental health application in the
world focuses on an individual feature or concept for the whole application. The proposed
application will focus on multiple functionalities and for different types of mental health
issues too.

Mental health issues are an on-going cycle in the world, and it isn’t going to stop, as we
can only help to cope with psychological issues and reduce the symptoms to the best of our
abilities. There could/might be other ways to improve a person’s mental health in the world,
but the proposed idea is on building an application to help a person to cope with and possibly
improve psychological health and a mobile phone is the first thing a person grabs to start
their day. 

Thus, I am building an application which is focusing on the following features:

1) Digital relaxation toys, to reduce stress
2) Music & breathing exercise, to help meditate
3) Mood checker, to learn what causes mood swings 
4) Routine planner, to improve a person's productivity
5) Greif refuge, to help people with depression and who have lost someone


I hope you enjoy this app :)
